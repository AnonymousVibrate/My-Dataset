Such a cute little game. Not too hard. The ads are very unobtrusive which I love. No need to see ads unless you want extra rewards or a revive without restarting. A balance very few mobile games seen to be able to achieve so I commend the developers! Edit: unfortunately though the game is only enjoyable to a certain extent. Eventually you reach a point where the only way to progress is to upgrade armor with real money. I tried to grind and even that is basically impossible.

"This game is a great example of what Vampire Survivors would be if it were in microtransaction heck. It is currently impossible to complete all daily goals due to features not existing, and there are a limited number of powers to have a viable run at any stage even after grinding to level up your gear.

Have to pay to have a sane progression. Built for in app purchase and balanced to make you want to purchase. Update: I decided to give it a try with the devs recommendation to gather resources and it is incredibly off balance. I am level 35 and the amount of gold received I am only able to get to the level 22 of the level bonuses. Clearly only add features you have to pay for.

"I agree with many complaints but it's fun at the same time and no ads is nice. The pay wall is indeed VERY steep. It does in fact take weeks, even months to pass a level later on. Projectiles do become lost in the chaos and even with armor to help mitigate them, they still just wreck you super fast. Weapons are not balanced to me. The bat is by FAR the best weapon and it's not even close imo. I prefer the blue bat over the purple sword even and the guns are just bad.

MICRO TRANSACTION TRAP. The game gets you hooked with great game play but once you get to the 10th lvl your forced to spend hundreds in micro transactions to keep advancing and every level after 10 gets worse and worse. ITS A TRAP and that sucks because the core game play is fun. Unfortunately you have to pay hundreds just to experience it. Also every event is designed so once your almost to the end your forced to spent money to complete the last little bit to get the prize.

But when there is only so many in the game after a certain point, and the rest are tied to progression, then i think one of two things is in order. Either make the items require less to merge or make items more plentiful, like after playing a game. Progression really does slow to a half around lvl 18 and its days on the same level.

It's a good first run for sure. Perhaps before monetizing though actually flesh it out.

Didn't want to write this but after countless frustrations ill say that this game is infuriating. Your character will get stuck in their slide pose more times than i can remember. It will lead to either falling off the map or loosing precious seconds. You will occasionally glitch through the map or take 3 more extra seconds to spawn back on the map. Which will 9 out of 10 times lead to a loss. The first couple of levels you will finish first often. But after level 9 the difficulty is hilarious.,3,105432669827952670224,Damian Birkhoff,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACNPEu-y7l9jn-uVkME9ArDZgx_zLmyqGpkqYAyn-5fOpA,0.39,1660679693,2022-08-16T19:54:53.000Z,70,,,

Pretty good. But after a long time (Like 1 year or 2) it gets kinda boring.

I really enjoyed this game until I had 6 heroes lvld around 100. The tutorials were awful but I managed to figure out most of it. When I was trying to upgrade the quality of my heroes I used a lvl 96 excellent to upgrade to excellent +. I meant for the lvl 97 hero to be the one upgraded.

Great game. Paid for no adds nd was worth it. Only issue I had is when you run out of moves it's very easy to mis-click your way to ending the game. Can happen with one click that you end the game instead of buying some coins to play on. Has happened to me twice and the 2nd time I played straight for two weeks. Lost all progress. I would have paid to keep going. Please add a pop up that says are you sure you wish to end.,4,107698652175847139568,Paul OoO,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACNPEu8wESKb8GeKBiOSYvpQ3xsuVIK3kP9DFaJARJeuTQ,280,1661383676,2022-08-24T23:27:56.000Z,135,"We are very sorry for the inconvenience ,We will forward your feedback to the design team to help add this feature.

It could be a fun game if not for a few issues. 1. You get to do like 4 moves before you have to start using gems to switch blocks around. It's very limited. 2. You are forced to watch an ad ever 4-5 moves (sometimes more) that give you a whole +5 gems (yaaaaaay...) 3.

Hi,
We are so sorry about the ads. We will revise the time between ads so you can play more without interruptions.
Also, if there is any ad that is causing some issue, please email us the screenshot of that ad at: support@inspiredsquare.com.
We will see to it that we ban that ad.

Thank You.

love it. a few too many short ads. So many games say play this to distress and only gets your anxiety up. I have to say this is a very relaxing game and makes you think about your choices in a move.

Great game so far Have spent less than $6 and been playing a few months now only a few times a week and still have no issues or complaints. If you build up supplies and join an alliance it's very easy game to advance in. Helping each other out and sharing rewards and improving the estate and guards stats are very rewarding. Straightforward game and NOT money hungry or PTW like some say. Offer very good and affordable deals with quality awards without being bombarded about it.

The random pop up ads in the middle of reading dialog do not benefit the player, but do take away from the playing experience as they pop up at awkward times.

"This is a fun game to play. I played this game through out the whole summer between 8th grade and freshman year. It was a calming escape from reality. Over that summer I was able to unlock every single skin that didn't cost money, I completed every single event over that summer, and it got my mind off of starting high school. This game made my transition from middle school to high school really easy. Way easier than most people in my grade. I really recommend downloading this game.

"This game is sooo fun!!! The only prob, is that ads come on often, and when your about to do something they come on, and Abt 5 sec after one ad, there's another. although it does 2 ads in-between 5 sec, only after you get caught,its a good thing that it doesn't do the ads before you play! :)",4,114244496808680511787,Kristen Halstead,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACNPEu9OYzLvAsqGExJs2ophjazk4V6Okp0I84mrlqFT,2.38.0,1660145413,2022-08-10T15:30:13.000Z,41,,,
"To be honest, this game is really underrated! It's a very good game, and there's nothing wrong with it. Some people are saying it always lags, but for me it doesn't. But there is kinda a problem about this game. Everytime when Im playing it, I swipe when the police is chasing me, but it's not working.

The only issue I have with this game is that if I pause it to take a break for a few mins and come back to the game. The app restarts itself. Due to this I've lost progress of scores of 50mil and 70mil. Other than that there are no issues.

My nephew accidentally paid 100 poinds into this game after 5 minutes of downloading it - I understand that I should have had payment protection however he hasnt used any of the items and google is refusing the refund. I am furious - I also cannot find a way to contact the devolpers.

"I love this through and through. Events are pretty frequent, there are lots of characters, maps, hoverboards .etc, but it's the ads. The ads don't even work most of the time and there all not even videos so I can't get my reward. Not only that, my super runner progress literally all just restarted and now I'm pissed off as hell.

"Cool game and I like how developed the game is. I still remember when the character skins were very expensive like 90,000 coins for one but I'm glad that it's now reduced. It's now cheap and easy to unlock. And I'm happy that there's option where you can change the music to one you like. Very cool word puzzles and rewards and you can even play for your country.

"It is a very fun game. It also gives you daily rewards and they're like enough to buy stuff. The coins collected during the round are accurately calculated.

"I used to play this game a long time ago. I just came back and the UI changes and new game modes are actually really good. However, I am not a big fan of the new loading screens, and I would love it if you brought back the old one in a modernized form. It would also be nice if you guys add hints of the old UI into the new one (the calendar background was iconic, and the distorted theme music that used to play on the loading screen).",4,112631968787381663916,√¶,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ACNPEu8I29IqyR64ryXMKam8DVDKbDQZVZ37rIwc9rD5lw,2.36.0,1657142077,2022-07-06T21:14:37.000Z,26078,,,
